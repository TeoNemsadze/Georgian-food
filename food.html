		<h1>Georgian cuisine</h1>
		<p>Georgian cuisine is a traditional cuisine of Georgia. Georgian cuisine has similarities with Caucasus cuisine. Every region of Georgia has its own distinct style of food preparation. Eating and drinking are important parts of Georgian culture.

Georgia was one of the countries on the Silk Road, which resulted in travelers influencing Georgian cuisine. The Georgian love of family and friends is one of the reasons why the supra (tablecloth) is so important in Georgia. Supra is offered spontaneously to relatives, friends or guests. Every supra has its tamada (toastmaster), who gives the toast and entertains the guests.</p>

	 	<h3 class="title1">1. Khachapuri</h3>
	 	<div class="box2">
	 	<div class="box1">
	 	    <p> Khachapuri is traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. The bread is leavened and allowed to rise and is shaped in various ways, usually with cheese in the middle and a crust which is ripped off and used to dip in the cheese. The filling contains cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly sulguni), eggs and other ingredients.</p>
	 	    <p>It is very popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. As a Georgian staple food, the price of making khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities by the "khachapuri index," developed by the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University. It is Georgia's national dish that is inscribed on the list of the Intangible cultural heritage of Georgia.[4] On the behalf and initiative of Gastronomic Association of Georgia, the 27th of February was announced as the National Khachapuri Day, to celebrate Georgia's timeless signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition internationally.</p>

	 	<div class="block">
	 		<p>Khinkali is a Georgian dumpling, which originated in China and was brought to Georgia during its conquest by Mongolians. The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe, the so-called khevsuruli, consisted of only minced meat (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, chili pepper, salt, and cumin. However, the modern recipe used mostly especially in Georgian urban areas, the so-called kalakuri, uses herbs like parsley and cilantro (also called coriander). Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.</p>

	 	<div class="four-box">
	 		Satsivi is a Georgian dish made from poultry such as turkey or chicken put into walnut sauce. The term satsivi is also used as a generic name for a variety of poultry made with the walnut sauce. Bazhe is the most versatile of Georgian walnut sauce more runny than satsivi sauce and often used for boiled or fried fish such as trout, made with either red wine vinegar or pomegranate juice. As is typical of the Georgian palate, this sauce is slightly tart, as sweeteners are not usually used by Georgians in their cooking.
